See live site here:

https://bc-notable-skill-assessment.herokuapp.com/

On live site or localhosted, you can get JSON data served if desired.

`/doctors`
- GET request
- This will give you a JSON response back with an array containing each doctor as an object.
- example: http://localhost:3000/Doctors or https://bc-notable-skill-assessment.herokuapp.com//Doctors

`/appointments/:doctor/:date`
- GET request
- This will give you a JSON response back with an array containing each appointment (as an object) for the specified doctor at the specified date.
- example: http://localhost:3000/appointments/Krieger,%20Algernop/2022-10-16 or https://bc-notable-skill-assessment.herokuapp.com//appointments/Krieger,%20Algernop/2022-10-16



### Requests made through interaction of created front-end (index.ejs) or other interface (I used Postman to test).

`/`
- GET request, home page, serves up index.ejs contains list of all doctors (as buttons on ejs), and appointments for all doctors for today's date (thought this was a nice touch).

`/getAppointments/:doctorId/:date`
- GET request, renders index.ejs again but with only specified doctor's / date's appointments.

`/newAppointment`
with body = 
{
"firstName": "string",
"lastName": "string",
"date": "yyyy-mm-dd",
"time": "24:00",
"kind": "string",
"doctor": "string",
"doctorId": "string"
}

- POST request, viewed as form inputs with submit button, on submission => "refreshes" page currently on with applicable information, adds appointment to DB
- requests will throw an error if not a 15min increment, or doctorId already has 3 appointments.
- time is in 24hr format (AM / PM for live site, auto converted on submission, I love HTML sometimes, especially the step attribute here)
- example: http://localhost:3000/newAppointment or https://bc-notable-skill-assessment.herokuapp.com//newAppointment with body {"firstName":"test","lastName":"1","date":"2022-10-16","time":"08:00","kind":"New Patient","doctor":"Hibbert, Julius","doctorId":"634c14224326e9435800ad99"}

`/deleteAppointment/:_id?_method=DELETE`
- Send as POST request, uses method-override to convert POST request to DELETE, viewed as buttons with each appointment, on click => "refreshes" page currently on with applicable information, deletes applicable appointment from DB

 or 

`/deleteAppointment/:_id`
- Send as DELETE request, responds with index.ejs, deletes applicable appointment from DB
- example: http://localhost:3000/deleteAppointment/634c14cf9664efd9528424d9 or https://bc-notable-skill-assessment.herokuapp.com//deleteAppointment/634c14cf9664efd9528424d9


Doctor and Appointment ID's are auto generated by MongoDB
